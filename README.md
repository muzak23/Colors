# Colors
Personal project to let users select their name color through the use of Essentials (or other plugin with a /nick command).

Requires the nick plugin to use the format `/nick (username) (nick)` and to allow colors (obviously).

## Permissions
`colors.base`: Base permission to let users use /color and all colors besides c and e

`colors.e`: Lets users use the e color (yellow). Reserved for moderators.

`colors.c`: Lets users use the c color (red). Reserved for administrators.

`colors.rainbow`
